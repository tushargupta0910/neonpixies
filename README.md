# neonpixies

NeonPixies is a top down 2D arcade shooter (2-player) which we have created as tribute to the eclectic era of the 80s- When Simple, Fulfiling games could be played at just a coin a live.

We have uploaded the assets and executables on our drive. all our code is on  github. download the folder from drive and run the neonpixies.exe file to play the game.
This game is for windows only right now.

The controls for shooting are hurried. We are sorry if you find down arrow and s very cramped. We can change the controls such that Right ctrl and LShift is used for shooting.

This project is just a prototype of what we envisioned. We can add more maps(with bouncy obstacles!); destructible walls(Walls when destroyed will depressurise the chamber and try to suck the players into oblivion!)

The Life system and music were rushed. They might not look polished. We could have improved that.

We have not had any experience with godot, and only one of us had created a pong clone (in unity) 3 years. This was our first project of godot, that too in a hackathon (felt more like a Game Jam). We hope you like our efforts (We have worked really hard for this)
